# License
The reason why I have chosen the MIT license is that I believe that my website could be used by other developers and upcoming developers to learn how to build their own portfolio website, or at least use it for their inspiration. With the MIT license, people can use and learn from my code as long as they give me credit and keep my license file. The MIT license is one of the most popular and widely used open-source licenses, and I fully believe that open-source projects and applications have lots of benefit to fellow developers around the world.
